# HTMX + Tailwind + Vite

Just a quick repo to get started on projects with the aforementioned tools. I've also included [json-enc](https://htmx.org/extensions/json-enc/), [client-side-templates](https://htmx.org/extensions/client-side-templates/), and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to work with JSON APIs. Remove these if you don't need them. If you prefer something other than Handlebars, install that instead. Both actions will require an update to `app.js`.

The _json-enc_ and _client-side-templates_ extensions are included in the repo. If you want or need a newer version, you'll have to download and replace them yourself. Although they are pretty simple so I doubt there'll be many changes to them.

To use it just enter the commands below and start coding:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once you're happy, do a prod preview:

```bash
npm run preview
```

And then build it:

```bash
npm run build
```

And that's pretty much it. Enjoy!
